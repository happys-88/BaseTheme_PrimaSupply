<div class="task-description-content"><p>Write a function:</p>
<p></p><blockquote><code>function solution(S);</code></blockquote><p></p>
<p>that, given a string S, returns jumbled words from this&nbsp;string. The first character in the string will be&nbsp;a number. This number tells us&nbsp;how many words need to be created and the number of pair of words that would be available further in the string for eg:</p>
<p><strong>"2, JASMEET, RAHUL, PIYUSH, ABHISHEK": </strong>would mean<strong>&nbsp;2 words</strong> need to be created from this string and<strong> 2 pairs of words </strong>will be passed which are<strong>&nbsp;JASMEET </strong>and<strong> RAHUL</strong> as one pair and<strong>&nbsp;PIYUSH </strong>and<strong> ABHISHEK&nbsp;</strong>as the other pair.</p>
<p><strong>"3, JASMEET, RAHUL, PIYUSH, ABHISHEK, ADITI, NIDHI" </strong>would mean<strong> 3 words</strong> need to be created and <strong>3 pairs of words</strong> would be passed which are&nbsp;<strong>JASMEET</strong> and<strong> RAHUL</strong> as one pair,&nbsp;<strong>PIYUSH&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;ABHISHEK</strong>&nbsp;as the second&nbsp;pair and<strong>&nbsp;ADITI</strong>&nbsp;and<strong> NIDHI&nbsp;</strong>as the third pair.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HOW TO CREATE THE WORD</strong></span></p>
<p>eg:&nbsp;<strong>"2, JAY, ROB, CAT, DOG"</strong></p>
<p>There are 2 words needs to be created.</p>
<p>First word gets created by the pair of <strong>JAY</strong> and <strong>ROB</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compare J of JAY&nbsp;with R of ROB: Since J is lexicography lower than R - it becomes the first letter of the new word.&nbsp;<strong>WORD SO FAR: J</strong></li>
<li>Since J is now selected - Compare A of JAY with R of ROB, again A comes before R so A becomes the second letter in the new word.&nbsp;<strong>WORD SO FAR: JA</strong></li>
<li>Since JA are selected already - Compate Y of JAY with R of ROB, now since R comes before Y - the next letter in the new word would be R. <strong>WORD SO FAR: JAR</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>And then you compare Y of JAY with O of ROB and so on.</p>
<p>The final word in this example would be:&nbsp;<strong>JAROBY</strong>.</p>
<p>Then you move on to the second word using the pair<strong> CAT </strong>and<strong> DOG,&nbsp;</strong>so the function will finally&nbsp;return&nbsp;<strong> "JAROBY, CADOGT"</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><br></strong>For another example, given S =&nbsp;<strong>"2, JASMEET, RAHUL, PIYUSH, ABHISHEK" </strong>the function should return "<strong>JARAHSMEETUL, ABHIPISHEKYUSH"</strong>.</p>
<p>You can assume that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the words&nbsp;will only consist of uppercase English alphabet letters</li>
<li>length of the words won't exceed 100 characters</li>
</ul>
<p>In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.</p></div>
